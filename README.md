# Full Stack Web Development Specialization
## Learn front-end and mobile hybrid development, build back-end support, and implement a fully functional application.
### Created by The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology & IBM Academic Initiative

The first two courses in this Specialization include an orientation to client-side development, covering HTML/CSS, JavaScript/JQuery, and frameworks such as AngularJS and Bootstrap. On the server side, you’ll learn to implement NoSQL databases using MongoDB, work within a Node.js environment, and communicate to the client side through a RESTful API. You’ll also learn to create hybrid mobile applications, using the Ionic framework and Cordova. In the final Capstone Project, you’ll apply your skills to build a fully functional web and hybrid mobile application with back-end support.
